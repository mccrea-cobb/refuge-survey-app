# Introduction  

Understanding annual activities for scheduled refuge surveys facilitates yearly accomplishment reporting, informs the development of Inventory and Monitoring Plans, and is useful for documenting lack of resources to conduct surveys. This report summarizes annual survey activity for scheduled surveys on National Wildlife Refuges in the `r region` Region in `r year_selected`. It provides a refuge-specific understanding about whether data were collected for scheduled surveys, and it quantifies reasons for why data were not collected for scheduled surveys. Finally, it summarizes which biotic groups and species were targeted by surveys that had data collected.


# Methods

The information used in this report originates from [PRIMR](https://ecos.fws.gov/primr/), a tool to store and retrieve information about survey activities occurring on Refuges. The PRIMR module allows users to document and catalog legacy, ongoing, and planned surveys. Refuge staff populate PRIMR with their historic, current, expected, and future surveys. This information is used to generate the refuge's Inventory and Monitoring Plan. 

Refuge scientists are requested by the Refuge Inventory and Monitoring Program to annually review and update their survey records in PRIMR. As a part of this effort, refuge scientists report on whether data were collected for each survey that was scheduled for data collection the previous calendar year. A scheduled survey is one that was expected to have data collected in `r year_selected` based on the survey start year and annual frequency listed in PRIMR (e.g., a survey that started in 2017 and occurs every 5 years). A survey is considered to have had data collected if data were collected at 75% or more of the scheduled sample sites in a given calendar year. If data were not collected, PRIMR requires users to enter a primary reason and optional comments to provide additional site-specific details. The list of possible reasons includes: 

- **Lack of refuge staff**: data not collected due to lack of staff, expertise or appropriate training
- **Lack of equipment**: data could not be collected due to lack of functional transportation, field or lab equipment/analysis, or sufficient supplies
- **Weather or disturbance**: data could not be collected because of weather (lasting snow, or storm damage) or other events (fire, toxic spill, global pandemic) that cause lack of physical access or hazard to staff
-  **Administrative**: data could not be collected due to a change of priorities, lack of permissions/permits, or change in protective status of survey area that prevented access to sampling sites
- **Partner resources**: data not collected because partner could not provide intended resources (funds, personnel time or equipment). 

Based on the annual update reporting provided by refuge staff and the information associated with refuge records in PRIMR, this report summarizes scheduled surveys in `r year_selected`. Summary information includes what surveys did and did not have data collected, by refuge; what reasons prevented data collection, and the biotic groups and species on which data was collected. Finally, the report provides summary information for `r year_selected` scheduled surveys, including links to products and protocols, for which data were collected.

This report was created in [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) using [this code](https://github.com/mccrea-cobb/refuge-survey-app/blob/master/annual_report.Rmd).

# Results

In `r year_selected`, refuges in the `r region` Region collected data on `r sum(completed$n)` surveys of `r sum(scheduled$n)` scheduled surveys (`r scales::label_percent()(sum(completed$n) / sum(scheduled$n))`) (Table \@ref(tab:tbl-activity)). Data were not collected for `r sum(incomplete$n)` surveys. The most commonly reported reason for data not being collected was `r tolower(dat_reasons$reason[1])` [`r dat_reasons$n[1]`] challenges followed by  `r tolower(dat_reasons$reason[2])` [`r dat_reasons$n[2]`] (Table \@ref(tab:tbl-reasons)). Based on comments associated with the reasons listed, COVID-19 restrictions prevented staff from collecting data on `r covid_comments` scheduled surveys.

In `r year_selected`, refuge scientists collected survey data on a variety of biotic groups and species. The most surveyed Biotic Level 1 group (n = `r bio1_sum$n[[1]]`) was `r as.character(bio1_sum$bio_grp[[1]])` (Figure \@ref(fig:plot-bio-grp1)). The most surveyed Biotic Level 2 group (n = `r bio2_sum$n[[1]]`) was `r as.character(bio2_sum$bio_grp[[1]])` (Table 3). The most surveyed species (n = `r spp_sum$n[[1]]`) was `r as.character(spp_sum$spp[[1]])` (Table 4).
